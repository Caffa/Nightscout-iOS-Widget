# Nightscout-iOS-Widget
This is a fork of https://gitlab.com/niepi/scriptable-nightscout-widget and requires the Scriptable App

pick either `single.js` or `twoPeople.js` depending on whether you want to show one or two nightscout info on your widget.

do remember to replace your url (and for two people, your names)

copy and paste into a scriptable and create a widget, selecting that script.

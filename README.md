# Nightscout-iOS-Widget
This is a fork of https://gitlab.com/niepi/scriptable-nightscout-widget and requires the Scriptable App

pick either `single.js` or `twoPeople.js` depending on whether you want to show one or two nightscout info on your widget

copy and paste into a scriptable and create a widget, selecting that script.
